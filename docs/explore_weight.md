# Slot: explore_weight
_Weight on the probability of visiting a neighbor node to the one we're coming from in the random walk Having this higher tends the walks to be more like a Depth-First Search. Having this very high makes search more outward. Having this very low makes search very local. Equal to the inverse of q in the Node2Vec paper._
